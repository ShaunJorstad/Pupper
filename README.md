# Puppr 
Puppr is an unfinished android app that allows local dog shelters to share dogs that are up for adoption with their community

This app is no longer under active development. As such the database has been modified to read only access for all user accounts.

## Install
- Install Android Studio and the latest android SDK
- Build the project and install on a phone or virtual machine

## Features 
- Separate User and Pet Shelter account creation, management, and recovery. These services will not work as the firestore datastore has been closed.
- Shelters can create profiles for every dog in their care. Each profile has a set of photos, name, description, age, and breed. 
- Users can swipe left and right on dog profiles close to their current location 
- Users can view their liked dogs

With further development the app would facilitate communication between the user and the shelters.
